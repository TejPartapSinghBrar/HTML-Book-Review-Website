        <h3>1.  The Women: </h3>
        <p>Review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Kristin Hannah's "The Women" transports you to the Vietnam War through the eyes of Frances "Frankie" McGrath, a young nurse. Witnessing the war's brutality firsthand, Frankie confronts not just physical dangers but the emotional toll. Back home, a changed America disregards the sacrifices made. This powerful novel poignantly honors female veterans and the enduring strength of friendship, reminding us of the human cost of war </li>

        <h3>2.  Dog Man: the Scarlet Shedder </h3>
        <p>Review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Dog Man's back in action, but this time he's red! A skunk spray and a tomato bath leave our hero ostracized and christened the Scarlet Shedder. But fear not, there's heroism to be found even in scarlet fur. This quirky tale throws in a hilarious new villain, the A.I.-powered Dog Man robot, and a reluctant team-up with Petey the Cat. </li>

        <h3>3.  A Court of Thorns and Roses </h3>
        <p>Review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Court of Thorns and Roses offers a thrilling Beauty and the Beast retelling dipped in darkness. Feyre, a fierce hunter, becomes entangled with the Fae world after slaying a creature. Transported to a magical court ruled by the brooding Tamlin, she uncovers a world of beauty hiding deadly secrets. Their connection simmers as Feyre defies expectations, but is Tamlin all he seems? The romance is a slow burn laced with tension, but some find it unhealthy. </li>

        <h3>4.  House of Flame and Shadow</h3>
        <p>Review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>House of Flame and Shadow, the fiery conclusion to Sarah J. Maas' Crescent City series, is a nonstop thrill ride. Bryce Quinlan, a powerful half-fae warrior resurrected by her friends, faces a cosmic threat alongside her brooding love interest, Hunt. The plot explodes with action as they race to stop the Asteri, a monstrous race, from destroying the world. This installment prioritizes action over character development, with Bryce's brash personality potentially grating on some readers. The romance takes a backseat, but the series' signature steamy scenes remain. While some might find the ending less epic than anticipated, the emotional core shines through. </li>

        <h3>7.  The Demon Of Unrest</h3>
        <p>Review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Erik Larson's The Demon of Unrest isn't your typical historical fiction.  It dives into the tumultuous months leading up to the American Civil War, using gripping narrative and primary sources.  The focus isn't on battles, but the political firestorm and personal dramas that propelled the nation towards conflict.  We see the hubris of leaders, the heartbreak of division, and the heroism of those desperately trying to avert disaster.</li>

        <h3>8.  Just For The Summer</h3>
        <p>Review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Escape to lakeside charm with Abby Jimenez's Just For The Summer. Emma, a traveling nurse, meets Justin, a local harboring a romantic curse (according to a wacky Reddit theory).  They strike a deal: a summer fling to break their supposed curses.  Expect witty banter and sizzling chemistry as their lakeside pact evolves into something deeper.  Jimenez's strength lies in relatable characters and heartwarming connections, but the "curse" element might feel quirky.  Still, Just For The Summer is a delightful summer read, perfect for those seeking a light romance with a touch of emotional depth.</li>

        <h3>9.  The Housemaid</h3>
        <p>Review:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buckle up for a suspenseful ride with Freida McFadden's The Housemaid.  Millie, a new hire, enters the luxurious home of the seemingly perfect Winchesters.  But beneath the surface lurk dark secrets and a web of psychological manipulation.  The narrative twists and turns, keeping you guessing as Millie unravels the truth.  McFadden excels at building a chilling atmosphere, but some might find the character development lacking.  Thrilling and unpredictable, The Housemaid is a perfect choice for fans of domestic suspense who crave a page-turner.</li>
